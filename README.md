Dissatisfied with twitter search functionality and codebase of ofxTwitter, refactored ofxTwitterStream to be able to add a 'connection' class for the search API.

- tested on Mac, Xcode 4
- using latest openFrameworks from GitHub (may 2011)

1) create a new group in your project 
2) draw and drop the "src" directory into this group

That's it!
